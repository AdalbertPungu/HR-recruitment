# HR-recruitment
Recruitment is a crucial process for any organization as its success can significantly impact the overall success of the business. Traditional recruitment methods can often be time-consuming and inefficient, leading to delayed hiring decisions and missed opportunities.
With technological advancements, organizations can now organize their recruitment processes for increased efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. 
In our project, we explored how to create an HR recruitment process using Power BI for tracking recruitment KPIs, we use Power Apps to create a Frequent Ask Question about HR processes and we use Power Automate to automate the process. This integration will ensure that users get accurate and helpful information quickly and easily.
